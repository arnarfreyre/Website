5. Click the "Level Editor" button to open the level editor

## Level Editor Usage

- Select tile types from the palette on the left
- Click or drag on the grid to place tiles
- Use the level selector to switch between levels or create new ones
- All levels are automatically saved to localStorage
- Preview your level in real-time and test it directly in the game

## Game Controls

## Integration Notes

The level editor and main game are integrated through localStorage. When you create levels in the editor, they are automatically available in the main game. This makes it easy to iterate on level design and test your creations.
